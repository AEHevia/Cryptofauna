# Cryptofauna
Code for the Cryptofauna twitter bot! (https://twitter.com/Cryptofauna)

## How to run
* run npm intsall
* Follow the instructions config_empty.js file
* Run index.js and youre good to go!


## TODO:
Lots of additional tasks can be done to improve the bot. The highest priority item is creating the sense of a persistent world with reoccuring creates and ever growing fauna, basically having tweets that reference old generated animals and create new ones, but here is the current roadmap:

* Convert to ES6+ Standards
* Migrate code to Typescript
* Architect the project better
* Write tests
* Find a better way to handle NLG
* Set up a Github actions pipeline
* Figure out a method to imbue actual coherence and intelligence to the generation, some sort of ontology
* Connect to a DB so creations are saved and can be rereferenced
* Investigate other generative methods
