Code for the Cryptofauna twitter bot! (https://twitter.com/Cryptofauna)

## How to run
* run npm intsall
* Follow the instructions config_empty.js file
* Run index.js and youre good to go!


## TODO:
Lots of additional tasks can be done to improve the bot. The highest priority item is creating the sense of a persistent world with reoccuring creates and ever growing fauna, basically having tweets that reference old generated animals and create new ones, but here is the current roadmap:

* Update sentence variety
* Migrate code to Typescript
* Set up a Github actions pipe
